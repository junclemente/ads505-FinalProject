# Project Intro / Objective

## Graduate Business School Dataset

I work as a consultant for small to mid-size and large organizations most especially startups that are data illiterate seeking how they they can effectively leverage data to improve their decision making. I was asked by a manager (name withheld) from business school start up to help their firm take data-driven decisions as opposed to intuitive traditional way they have been adopting. The dataset is from their first graduating class of their MBA program including details and scores from their application, the program itself and their status after 2 months.

### Potential Business Case
Create a model to determine which students to accept that will be successful after graduation from their MBA program.
