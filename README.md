# Project Intro / Objective

A business school startup is interested to know if itâ€™s possible to take a data-driven approach for accepting students into their MBA program as opposed to their current method of intuition. Using a data-driven approach could uncover patterns in admissions and improve decision-making efficiency, resulting in better student outcomes.

This project will identify a list of factors that highly correlate with an MBA graduate who finds employment within two months of graduation. Using a data-driven approach has the potential to improve admissions accuracy ensuring that the school continues to produce high graduation and employment placement rates. This could position the school as a prestigious, trustworthy school for prospective MBA students.

# Project Description 

## Data Dictionary

- Student ID: a unique identifier for each business school student.
- Undergrad Degree: The student's undergraduate degree.
- Undergrad Grade: The student's final grade average from their undergrad degree (0-100).
- MBA Grade: The student's final grade average from our master's degree program (0-100).
- Work Experience: Indicator of the student's work experience prior to the program (Yes/No).
- Employability (before): The student's score from a third-party test that measures their appeal to employers in selected industries, taken during the admission process (0-500).
- Employability (after): The student score from the same test, taken after obtaining their Master's.
- Status: Indicator of the student's employment status (Placed/Not Placed).
