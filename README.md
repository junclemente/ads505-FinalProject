## Graduate Business School Dataset

I work as a consultant for small to mid-size and large organizations most especially startups that are data illiterate seeking how they they can effectively leverage data to improve their decision making. I was asked by a manager (name withheld) from business school start up to help their firm take data-driven decisions as opposed to intuitive traditional way they have been adopting. The dataset is from their first graduating class of their MBA program including details and scores from their application, the program itself and their status after 2 months.

### Potential Business Case
Create a model to determine which students to accept that will be successful after graduation from their MBA program.

## Should This Loan be Approved or Denied?

The dataset is from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)

The U.S. SBA was founded in 1953 on the principle of promoting and assisting small enterprises in the U.S. credit market (SBA Overview and History, US Small Business Administration (2015)). Small businesses have been a primary source of job creation in the United States; therefore, fostering small business formation and growth has social benefits by creating job opportunities and reducing unemployment.

There have been many success stories of start-ups receiving SBA loan guarantees such as FedEx and Apple Computer. However, there have also been stories of small businesses and/or start-ups that have defaulted on their SBA-guaranteed loans.

### Potential Business Case

Create a model to determine whether the loan should be approved or denied.

## Credit Card customers

A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate if one could predict for them who is gonna get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction.

### Potential Business Case

Create a model to predict which customers will be churned.
